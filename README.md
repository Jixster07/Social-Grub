# Social-Grub

# Project Vision Statement

Our product is for the social media realm of food, connecting food lovers, restaurant owners, and the average individual together. Our product will solve the need for more advertisement or discovery for people who would like to get their cooking ideas out to the world in a detailed fashion or find new ones. The product name is Social Grub. It is a free mobile application that intrigues the user to use it as another social media platform. Unlike the competing cooking/recipe market, Social Grub focuses on a user driven interface rather than a corporate one. Social Grub will provide a general forum board where users can interact.

Users will be able to post their recipes and search recipe results. This will allow them to select certain requirements and the query will return the highest rated recipes that fulfill their specific needs. The query can also be based on their food preferences and list recipes based on these preferences. Additionally, users can link accounts with another user in which the recipes will be shared. This is especially useful for larger families in which multiple people cook and want to share recipes easily. Social Grub will enable a social media food experience like no other.
